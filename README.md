# Foodcard - a simple recipe builder & printer üçΩÔ∏è

This was a simple project using React to test out state and props.

Input a recipe, include a picture, and see a live preview of the printable version, or save as a PDF for later usage.

Uses 'react-to-print' to handle the print functionality.

Buttons and design all custom made.

# Later features to add:

    Saving multiple recipes
    User login to store own recipes
    Design updates
    etc
